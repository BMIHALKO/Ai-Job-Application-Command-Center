# AI Job Application Command Center

A production-focused AI system to track job applications, analyze job descriptions, evaluate recruiter messages, and generate daily job-search action plans.

## Core Idea
This project centralizes the job search process and augments it with AI:
- Track applications and statuses in one place
- Analyze job descriptions for fit, skills, and seniority
- Evaluate recruiter messages for legitimacy and role quality
- Generate follow-up suggestions and daily action priorities

This is designed as a real, day-to-day — not a demo.

## Planned Features
- Application tracking with status workflows
- AI-powered job description analysis (skills, seniority, fit score)
- Recruiter message legitimacy & fit analysis
- Follow-up reminders with suggested responses
- Daily job search briefing ("What should I do today?")

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Frontend: React / Next.js
- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- AI: LLM APIs with structured outputs
- Auth: JWT or managed auth provider

## Status
🚧 Initial Setup and database-first design
